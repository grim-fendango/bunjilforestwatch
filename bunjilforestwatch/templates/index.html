          <h2>Volunteers</h2>
           <p>Volunteers sign up to monitor satellite images on behalf of local conservation groups. Volunteers need not be associated with the local hero or the forest they are protecting. They will be asked to check new satelite images as soon as they are published and report any disturbances. To be a volunteer you must be prepared to complete regular observation tasks when requested. You will need internet access.</p>

		<h1>About Bunjil</h1>
		<p>For Local Conservation Groups in Remote Forest Areas:
<i>“We wish to protect our land from illegal clearing. So we want to know about any disturbances as soon as possible so that we can respond effectively. We don’t know how to find or read satellite images and can’t afford to pay someone. If a service could just email or text us when our land is cleared, we could better protect our land.”</i></p>
